# Day 03 — Java
### Threads

### Exercise 00 — Egg, Hen... or Human?


Chicken or egg

The truth is born in an argument — let us assume that each thread gives its own answer. The thread that has the last word is right.

You need to implement the operation of two threads. Each of them must display its answer a few times, for example 50:
```
$ java Program --count=50
Egg
Hen
Hen
Hen
...
Egg
```
In this case, the egg thread wins. However, the program also contains a main thread. Inside the thread, the method public static void main(String args[]) is executed. We need this thread to display all its responses at the end of program execution. So the final variant is as follows:
```
$ java Program --count=50
Egg
Hen
Hen
...
Egg
Hen
...
Human
...
...
Human
```
It means that the program outputs Human message 50 times, which main thread prints.


### Exercise 01 — Egg, Hen, Egg, Hen...


Let's orchestrate the argument. Now, each thread can only give its answer after another thread has done so. Let's say the egg thread always responds first.

```
$ java Program --count=50
Egg
Hen
Egg
Hen
Egg
Hen
...
```

**Note**:<br>
To solve this task, we recommend to explore Producer-Consumer model operation principle.


### Exercise 02 — Real Multithreading


Try to use multithreading for its intended purpose: distributing computations throughout the program.

Let's say you have an array of integer values. Your goal is to compute the sum of the array elements using multiple "summing" threads. Each thread computes a particular section within the array. The number of elements in each section is constant, except for the last one (its size can vary upwards or downwards).

The array is randomly generated each time. The array length and the number of threads are passed as command line arguments.

To make sure the program works correctly, we should first calculate the sum of the array elements using a standard method.

The maximum number of array elements is 2,000,000. Maximum number of threads is not greater than the current number of array elements. Maximum modulo value of any array element is 1,000. All data is guaranteed to be valid.

Example of program operation (each array element is equal to 1):
```
$ java Program --arraySize=13 --threadsCount=3
Sum: 13
Thread 1: from 0 to 4 sum is 5
Thread 2: from 5 to 9 sum is 5
Thread 3: from 10 to 12 sum is 3
Sum by threads: 13
```

**Notes**:
- In the example above, the size of the last summary section used by the third thread is smaller than the others.
- Threads can output the results of operations inconsistently.


### Exercise 03 — Too Many Threads...


Let's say we need to download a list of files from a network. Some files will be downloaded faster than others.

To implement this functionality, we can obviously use multithreaded downloading, where each thread loads a specific file. But what do we do when there are too many files? A large number of threads cannot run at the same time. So many of them will be waiting.

In addition, we should keep in mind that continuously creating and closing threads is a very expensive operation that we should avoid. It makes more sense to start N threads at once, and when one of them finishes downloading the file, it can pick up the next file in the queue.

We need to create a files_urls.txt file (the filename must be explicitly specified in the program code) where you can specify a list of URLs of files to be downloaded, for example:
```
1 https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/19/2e/11192eba63f6f3aa591d3263fdb66bd5.jpg

```
Example of the program operation:
```
$ java Program.java --threadsCount=3
Thread-1 start download file number 1
Thread-2 start download file number 2
Thread-1 finish download file number 1
Thread-1 start download file number 3
Thread-3 start download file number 4
Thread-1 finish download file number 3
Thread-2 finish download file number 2
Thread-1 start download file number 5
Thread-3 finish download file number 4
Thread-1 finish download file number 5
```
**Notes**:
- The output produced by the implemented program may differ from the illustration.
- Each file is downloaded only once by a single thread.
- The program may contain an "infinite loop" without an exit condition (in this case, the program can be terminated by interrupting the process).
